==A Shorturl Service for Wikipedia Projects by Node.js==

For many languages which dose not use Latin characters, the URL of an articles in Wikipedia might be very long.
In order to help people on this problem, We create this small project to solve it.

It uses MediaWiki API call to get pageId by the title, and then convert pageId by base 36 to the short url.
To reduce the frequency of API call, a simple cache was used.

===Install===

Steps are as below:

* Clone the repository: git clone git://github.com/mountain/shortify.git
* Change directory to shortify: cd shortify
* Edit the settings: nano settings.json
